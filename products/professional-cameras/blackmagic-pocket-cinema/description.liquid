<h1>Wide Dynamic Range</h1>
<h3>Retain more image detail for more color grading power</h3>

<p>What makes film look like film? Frame rate, depth of field, noise and other factors are all part of the answer, however all cinematographers agree that Dynamic Range is the major reason. Video cameras are not able to handle light in the same way as film and their narrower dynamic range causes highlights to ‘blow out’ and shadows to appear ‘crushed’. The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera delivers a true film look because it captures a super wide dynamic range of 13 stops, so your images look truly cinematic. This means you retain all sensor data for DaVinci Resolve color grading!</p>


<p>The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera lets you shoot in either Film or Video mode to suit your needs. In Film mode the full dynamic range from the camera’s image sensor is recorded, so that with color correction you have the maximum information in the highlights and shadows of the images. When you shoot in Video mode the camera processes the images within the Rec709 color space that is a standard for HDTV. Video mode is perfect in situations where you need to deliver a project quickly that does not require color correction.</p>
