<p>The Blackmagic Design HyperDeck Shuttle 2 SSD Video Recorder records uncompressed 10-bit HD and SD video as QuickTime files from any SDI- or HDMI-enabled camcorder. This updated version of the original HyperDeck Shuttle also records Avid's DNxHD 220x 10-bit codec. The extremely compact recorder accepts a 2.5" SATA solid state drive (sold separately) for data storage. Simply by bypassing the camera's compression, this allows you to get the highest-quality output possible from camcorders that typically record video as highly compressed HDV, AVCHD, or another similar codec.</p>

<p>With its uncompressed recording capability, HyperDeck Shuttle 2 shines on those projects for which even high-bit-rate ProRes and DNxHD codecs are too compressed for your needs. Perhaps you're shooting against a green screen and you'll need to be able to pull the cleanest key possible in post, or you're capturing background plates for special effects. Whatever the application, capturing to a supremely portable device with interchangeable media (which, with each succeeding generation, will grow in capacity as prices drop) is about the most elegant solution imaginable for recording uncompressed 4:2:2 HD video.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, capacity is an issue, and HyperDeck Shuttle 2 offers the option of recording high-bit-rate compressed files. For Avid users, it doesn't get much more convenient than capturing 10-bit video as the extremely high-quality DNxHD 220x codec. Ready for the Media Composer timeline immediately, the MXF file type is available for 1080i59.94, 1080p29.97, and 720p59.94 formats.</p>

<p>The device features HDMI and SDI outputs for local playback from the device to an appropriate monitor on-set or in a screening room. HyperDeck Shuttle 2 features both a rechargeable internal Li-ion battery and a 12V DC power input that allows you to plug the device into a wall socket for continuous power.</p>
