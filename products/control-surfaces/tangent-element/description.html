<p>With today’s multi-purposing work stations, where desk space is at a premium, having a fully featured panel that is compact, fully featured and stylish enough to match its surroundings is a must. But, you’d expect that having a compact design means having to compromise ergonomics, features and control size. With the Element range, there is no compromise!</p>

<p>Despite their small desk foot print, each Element offers full size controls which are ergonomically laid out, and best of all, there’s lots of them!</p>


<h2>Intuitive</h2>


<p>When it comes to having lots of controls, one of the
problems can be "just what does each control do?" This isn't the case with
Element; every programmable control is clearly labelled, so if the function of
the control changes, so does its display label – no more having to refer back
to reference notes or on screen help. When Element panels are used with
Tangent's TUBE software, you can even customise the layout of the controls,
making them even more intuitive to use.</p>


<h2>Function and style</h2>


<p>Apart from the size, the first thing you will notice
about Element is the stylish, ultra slim design. Quality comes in the form of a
solid aluminium, precision laser cut case. But it doesn’t end there; all the
internal components have been carefully chosen for reliability. All rotary
controls and trackerballs have optical pickups, which means they are long-life
and high precision. The buttons are ultra-reliable with a positive tactile
response. The displays are crisp, high-contrast, high-resolution, easy to read,
white OLEDs. When put side by side the panels magnetically lock together,
keeping the layout neatly aligned.</p>


<h2>Cost effective</h2>


<p>You would have thought that all this comes with a
high price tag - not so with Element! Each Element is competitively priced, and
because it’s modular in design you can pick and choose which components you
need, targeting your funds where they’re needed most. And if your budget allows
it, you can even add more of the same panel type to build your ultimate control
surface.</p>
