<p>	
The Resolve Mini Panel is a new compact panel from BlackMagic Design that is designed for use with DaVinci Resolve. You get three professional trackballs along with a variety of buttons for switching tools, adding color correctors and navigating your node tree. It also features two color LCD screens that display menus, controls and parameter settings for the selected tool, along with direct access buttons that let you go into to the menus for specific DaVinci features. New to this Panel is the ability to connect via Ethernet or USB-C, for the first time you will not need to include the added cost and complexity of USB extenders when the workstation is not local to the room. The DaVinci Resolve Mini Panel is ideal for editors and colorists that need to regularly switch between editing and color grading, or for freelance colorists that need to take their panel with them when moving between facilities.
