<p><strong>Genesis RX2 RAID</strong> series is a line of purpose-built, feature-rich adaptable RAID or SAN appliances that integrate RAID 6 technology with the latest industry-standard hardware components. Designed by the engineers at Scale Logic, the Genesis RX2 features a unique set of tools that simplify shared storage while delivering top-level performance. Genesis RX2 has the ability to “leap-frog” other manufacturers’ hardware ASIC-based RAID controller roadmaps and is a affordable, high-bandwidth, cross-platform storage platform for Mac, Windows and Linux users.</p>

<p>The Genesis RX2 RAID platform is available in either a 12,24, or 36-Bay and can be configured with a combination of 8Gb or 16Gb Fibre Channel, 10Gb iSCSI Ethernet, or Infiniband. This enhanced flexibility of protocols allows for a multi-tiered approach to connection allocation. Giving you the ability to configure your highest performance workstations with 8Gb or 16Gb fibre, while also supporting multiple editors and sound engineers via a simpler 10Gb iSCSI network. You can even get the performance and reliability of fibre channel without the costly addition of a dedicated FC switch and network. The Genesis RX2 RAID system can be fitted with up to 12 8Gb or 6 16GB fibre channel ports without the need for a FC switch. Only need a few ports? Fit the rest with 10Gb iSCSI to share the storage with the remainder of your facility over the already in-place IP/Ethernet network.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">SAN Appliance Capable</h2>

<p>The Genesis RAID system can be uniquely used as both a HyperFS SAN metadata controller and RAID device for small workgroups, while allowing for expansion without moving the data to a traditional external MDC SAN setup. This gives smaller facilities the cost benefit to use a more reliable, expandable Global File System but the peace of mind that they can always expand without the effort of forklift upgrades or moving data after outgrowing a single Genesis.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Designed for Digital Media Applications</h2>

<p>The Genesis RAID is built with only media formats in mind. The pre-tuned read and write cache settings are preset and ready out of the box for H.264 to 4K and beyond. The Genesis RAID is a video RAID built for video, not an IT RAID tweaked for video. Because the system is pre-tuned the Genesis setup time and setup consulting time is greatly lessened. Any guess work is gone.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Advanced Read and Write Operations</h2>

<p>The very large read and write cache of the Genesis RAID systems hold much more data on writes and reads adding to the superior latency characteristics of the Genesis system. The Genesis RAID algorithm is also designed to skip and calculate parity for the 2 slowest drives on each and every read request, to greatly eliminate drive born latencies. There are less dropped frames on a Genesis system due to HDD latency issues.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Dramatically Faster Rebuilds</h2>

<p>Genesis has a partial rebuild feature that only rebuilds a small sector area if a HDD medium defect is encountered. The Genesis RAID I/O ports can sense host data activity. Also that allows Genesis to utilize 100% of the HDD bandwidth to rebuild operations when there is time of no I/O. When the Genesis is rebuilding, there is no faster way to rebuild a drive since the rebuild HDD is sequentially writing as fast as it is capable. As soon as there is I/O from an edit bay the rebuild pauses, allowing all throughput to the application.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">QoS Initiator</h2>

<p>Many QoS technologies remain difficult to setup and change on the fly, however the Genesis RAID QoS feature allows a very simple click in the GUI or a scriptable setting to make one or more host machines connected to the Genesis have bandwidth priority. This setting instantly makes all non-QoS Initiator systems share the bandwidth that is left over.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Silent Data Corruption Protection</h2>

<p>Silent Data Corruption remains the worst kind of data corruption because it is very tough to detect and eliminate. The Genesis RAID6 algorithm is fast enough to detect and fix silent data corruption with low detectable latency to the applications in use.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">iSCSI and/or FC Support</h2>

<p>iSCSI and FC protocols continue to outperform standard network protocols for media by removing much of the standard networking overhead and in the case of FC, demanding perfect packet delivery. Genesis’ multi-protocol support allows you to choose the right protocol for the right job.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Drive Quality and Performance</h2>

<p>The Genesis RAID can handle HDD bad blocks or media defects more intelligently than other RAID predecessors. This helps ensure data integrity. The individual drive performance latency counters can help find and replace a slowly performing HDD. This helps ensure read and write performance.</p>
