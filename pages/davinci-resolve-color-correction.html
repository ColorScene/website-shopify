				Unlimited Grades
			</h3>
			<p>DaVinci Resolve uses node-based processing where each node can have independent color correction, power windows and effects. Nodes are similar to layers, but are more flexible because you can combine nodes either in series or in parallel. There are nodes types that mix grades and others that assign priority, and key signals can be routed separately to multiple destinations. This means you can combine grades, effects, mixers, keys and even plug-ins in any order to create unique looks and unlimited color effects . To simplify things, you can collapse multiple nodes into a single compound node then save it to your Gallery as a “look” you can use on other scenes or other projects!

				<p>You get multiple built in real time transitions including cross and additive dissolves, wipes, dip to color, and more. Transitions can be aligned on the center of the edit, or at the start or end of the edit. You can even adjust transition duration dynamically and set ease in and out as you need. Transitions from FCP X and other editing software come in via imported XML and AAF’s and you can even use your favorite OpenFX plug-in for those extra special transitions between clips or tracks.

				<h3>
					Optical Flow Retiming 
				</h3>
				<p>Changing speeds can cause undesirable artifacts like stepping shots on slow downs due to “missing frames” or that jump frame you see on speed ups. DaVinci Resolve features nearest, frame blend and a superb “Optical Flow” image processing engine that uses advanced algorithms to create in between frames in real time! That means you can always select the smoothest, highest quality retimed clips whether you create slow and fast motion speed changes and it’s all in real time.</p>
