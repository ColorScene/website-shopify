	<p>Invented in partnership with Hollywood studios, DaVinci has been the standard in post production for over 30 years. DaVinci Resolve is the real time grading system that’s been used worldwide on more feature films, episodic television productions, commercials, independent films and music videos than any other.

			<h3>
				Unlimited Grades
			</h3>
			<p>
				DaVinci Resolve uses node based processing where each node can have color correction, power windows and effects. Nodes are similar to layers, but more powerful because you can join unlimited nodes sequentially or in parallel. That means you can combine grades, effects, mixers, keys and even plug-ins in any order to create limitless color effects and unique looks. If things get too crowded you can collapse multiple nodes into a single compound node then save it to your Gallery as a “look” to be used on other scenes!
